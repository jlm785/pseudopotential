This directory may contain detailed information of the interfaces of all files, and other
relevant information.

If documentatin.html is present just open it with your browser.

If documentation.html is not present, check that your computer has doxygen and graphviz installed.

Doc$ dpkg -s doxygen
Doc$ dpkg -s graphviz

in debian based distributions like ubuntu.
If they are not just install them

Doc$ sudo apt install doxygen
Doc$ sudo apt install graphviz

again in Debian based distros.

Run doxygen in the doxy directory

Doc/doxy$ doxygen Doxyfile

Then just link html/index.html to here

Doc$ ln -s html/index.html documentation.html

If the documentation is already present just refresh the link.



If you have LaTeX installed go to the userguide directory and run it (twice) on
the two TeX files,

Doc/user guide$ pdflatex atom_file
Doc/user guide$ pdflatex atom_file
Doc/user guide$ pdflatex user_guide
Doc/user guide$ pdflatex user_guide

to have a description of the atom.dat file adapted from the SIESTA documentation and a user
guide on how to compile and run the present code.
