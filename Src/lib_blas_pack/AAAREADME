This directory contains blas, linpack and lapack subroutines used by the atom program.
BLAS subroutines were updated to 3.8.0, so have fortran90 features:-)
linpack subroutines were upgraded to fortran90 style.

lapack subroutines iparmq.f and dlaebz.f may have some warnings during compilation of unused variables...

Old eispack subroutines were replaced with LAPACK subroutines to avoid the obsolescent feature (in fortran2003)
of a computed GOTO and arithmetic IF.  Unfortunately ilaenv.f still has a computed goto:-(
