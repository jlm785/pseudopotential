Numerical subroutines used by the atom program

ft_*.f90         :  Fourier transforms for different situations.  Could be simplified
                    but if ain't broken don't fix it...

poly_interp.f90  :  Lagrange polynomial interpolation with derivatives.  Couldn't find
                    a code on the net after googling, and writing was faster than
                    keeping googling...

sbessj.f90       :  Spherical Bessel function.

spli*.f90        :  Spline interpolation.  A "golden oldie" set of subroutines modernized to fortran90.

broyden*.f90     :  A reverse communication interface to solve non-linear equations.
