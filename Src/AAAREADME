To compile the code, edit make.inc to choose the compiler and respective options.

To compile all programs just run "make".

To clean just run "make clean"

Obviously if you know how to use make you can compile just what you want.

The programs are:

atom.f90          All-electron calculation or pseudopotential test.
psd_gen.f90       Pseudopotential construction.
kb_conv.f90       Converts to Kleinman-Bylander form.
kb_test.f90       Test the pseudopotential in the KB form.
plot_show.f90     Plots to compare all-electron with pseudopotential results.
plot_kb_show.f90  Plots related to the KB projectors.
plot_ln_show.f90  Plots of the log derivatives (scattering) of the potentials.

atom_all.f90      Does all of the above in the correct sequence.

After compiling

"atom_all.exe Si" will just do all the work for the element Si.
