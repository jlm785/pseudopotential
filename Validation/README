Checking the full program for all named elements.

The list of named elements is in the file "list_elements"

Running the bash script run.sh will apply the full program to each
named element.  Edit the path to executable to test the code you want to test.

For element X a res_X directory will be created with the results for that element.
Check figures and the file atom.out.  You will also have the pseudopotential
files that you can use in other codes.

The file "ptb.out" will contain a summary of the code execution.  If everything
went normal you should see a few lines with comparison of ionization energies and
excitation energies.  Check they are similar.




With gfortran you may see:

Note: The following floating-point exceptions are signalling: IEEE_UNDERFLOW_FLAG IEEE_DENORMAL

you should not worry. Just means something is too close to zero.  It first occurs in
the spline interpolations for calculating the Fourier transforms. I (JLM) did not
bother to rewrite the code to avoid that warning.
